# test Theme
Wordpress theme createt using basic Wordpress, PHP, HTML, SASS and BOOTSTRAP.

Basicly this company gave me assignment to make child theme based on their parent theme. 
So they have many request and tasks for me to be done. 
From making a child theme, registering a new custom post type and so one..

In parent theme you can see the tasks in child theme you can see what have i done, of course they send me a psd file whit everything i needed.

You need to this test in 4 hours, so that's why my single.php page is not customised in css as well as my archive.php.
